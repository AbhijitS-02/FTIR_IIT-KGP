# Adenomyosis and Endometriosis disease classification using FTIR data and machine learning

This repository contains the scripts and results to preprocess and analyze ***Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy*** (FTIR) data of **endometrium** tissue belonging to **Adenomyosis**, **Endometriosis** and **Control** disease classes. Using a ***machine learning approach***, FTIR spectral data was leveraged to design models to predict Adenomyosis and Endometriosis - two diseases with similar clinical manifestations. All experiments were performed at the Clinical Biomarkers Research Laboratory, School of Medical Science and Technology, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India. Data may be available upon request.

## Run the code

  1. Clone the repository using terminal:
